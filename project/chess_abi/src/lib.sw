    // contract must know the current game state—or at least whose turn it is. A player can first call moveFromState() to inform the smart contract of the latest agreed-upon state and to apply their latest move. This makes it their opponent’s turn and allows the timeout to be started. In response to a timeout, the player whose turn it is must make a move by calling move(). This resets the timer and lets the game continue.
